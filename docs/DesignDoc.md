## Architecture and Design

This section describes the application architecture.

### Software Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](<../media/Architecture Diagram HW 5.png>)

We will be using a Model-View-Controller architecture for our system. The view will be done using the React framework for HTML/JS/CSS. It will be responsible for displaying the information to the user and capturing their inputs. The inputs will then be used by the controller to either change the page that is being displayed to the user and show them new information or to further process data such as text inputs. Information that needs to be stored will be captured by the controller and sent over HTTPS requests to a Node.JS backend utilizing a REST API. This data will be processed into a form that allows for easy storage and retrieval as nessecary and stored in a MongoDB database. Examples of information that might be stored would be user logins, user logs and goals, and detailed food information. The backend would also handle any sensitive or complex processing such as user authentication or modeling. Due to the design of our system all information requests to display will flow from the view to the controller then to the model then back up since out backend and database will be one in the same.
### Use Cases

![Use Cases](https://github.com/PEIWEI311/NutritionTracker/blob/main/media/SWEN%20732-hwk5%20use%20case.jpeg)

In the use case diagram, there is one actor: User. There're ten use cases for user. At the beginning, user should register an account and log in with user name and password, and that's 'User registration and authentication'  use case. After that, it can modify the profile of the account. Then user can track data for calorie, water intake and weight. The application provide user with a graphic dashboard showing the daily progress. The application has nutrition data for common food items which user can add them into their daily food log. It also allows users to create and save their own food item._


### Class Diagram

![Class Diagram](https://github.com/PEIWEI311/NutritionTracker/blob/main/media/Class%20Diagram-CAZAM.png)

Our system will have a User object which will hold a user's personal data 
including their tracked health information and custom food items

Several functional elements of our application will be composed of "DataTrackers"
which are responsible for dates, times, and values of entries relevant to their specifications

So far we have a weight tracker, water intake tracker, and daily food tracker. Weight tracker and water intake tracker will
be fairly straight forward. Daily Food tracker will interact with FoodEntry objects.

Food entries themselves can contain ingredients (other food entries)
and a nutrient breakdown.

NutrientBreakdown objects are a collection of nutritional information similar to a 
miniature digital nutrition label
